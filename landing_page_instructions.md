# Dinner Event Landing Page Instructions

## Overview
Create a beautiful, elegant landing page for a dinner party event. The page will serve as a gateway to the ticketing platform (Ticketmelon) and will be hosted for free on GitHub Pages (no custom domain required).

## Flow
1. **Enter the site**
    - The logo (minimalist, as shown in the first attached image) slowly and elegantly fades in.
2. **Logo transition**
    - The logo fades out automatically.
    - The text logo "rie." (as shown in the second image) fades in.
3. **Form appearance**
    - The "rie." logo smoothly moves up a bit.
    - The name input field and "RSVP" button fade in from below (as shown in the third and fourth images).
4. **RSVP button**
    - When clicked, the RSVP button leads to the external Ticketmelon ticketing platform.
    - No data is collected or stored from the name input field.

## Design
- **Minimalist, elegant, and modern**
- **Centered content** with generous whitespace
- **Typography**: Use a clean, modern serif or sans-serif font similar to the design
- **Animations**: Smooth, subtle fade and movement transitions
- **Responsiveness**: Should look good on both desktop and mobile

## Technical Requirements
- **No backend**: Purely static site (HTML/CSS/JS or React/Vite, etc.)
- **No data collection**: Name input is for user experience only
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages**
- **Easy to update the Ticketmelon link**

## Assets
- Use the provided logo and text logo as shown in the attached images
- If SVGs or high-res assets are needed, request them
